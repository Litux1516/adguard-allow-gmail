Since the list No-Google from https://github.com/nickspaargaren/no-google for AdGuard is too restrictive, I have created a list of files. Those files come in two version of each categorie. One version is a blocking list and the other version is an allowing list.

This is usefull if you want to have access to Gmail for example.
